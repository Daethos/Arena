# The Ascea: Last Duel

### Ahh, the The Ascea. Much has been said of such a wonderful event that couldn’t possibly be put into words as eloquent as the cheers of the crowd, the gracious acceptance of rewards, and the lingering scent of trade and diplomacy as is seen during the games. This was truly a master stroke penned by the leaders of our great Licivitas, and much is owed to them in lieu of their assembly, not just from our people, but all across the realm. Not a single tournament has ever afforded the opportunity to increase relations with people who are your neighbors you had never met, nor barter for objects of desire, or perhaps necessities you hadn’t known were available. It is for many reasons known as what mends the realm from splitting once more into a greater and terrible _Sundering_.

### Now that we've gotten that pageantry out in the open, welcome to the last duel of the Ascea! The _grand melee_ of the Ascean
