# The Ascea: Last Duel

## Ahh, the The Ascea not a single tournament has ever afforded the opportunity to increase relations with people who are your neighbors you had never met, nor barter for objects of desire, or perhaps necessities you hadnâ€™t known were available. It is for many reasons known as what mends this world from frothing into war and splitting once more into a greater and terrible _Sundering_.
<br/><br/>

>### Okay, actually this is an homage to hobby-made action rpgs called **MUDs**, or Multi-User Dungeon, whom out eternal [reference][Wikipedia Link] canonically states to <br/><br/>
>#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, interactive fiction..., " and "with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or powers." <br/><br/>
>### Chilling. And this game attempts to celebrate with as many amusing facets as once were had with an emphasis on **combat**. You are set to choose your selection of weapon, shield, and armor or have it chosen for you, dueling against your final opponent of much higher renown, seen as the favorite. This unfortunately will be to the death, _not that there's anything wrong with that_, so I do recommend experimenting with different gear sets to see what complements each other.
<br/><br/>  

## Now that we've gotten that pageantry out in the open, welcome to the last duel of the Ascea! The _grand melee_ of the Ascean festival ends when eight contestants remain in honor of the eight great provinces. Combat is halted and weapons are cast anew before resuming, occuring once more when down to the last duel--**and here you are**.

# Getting Started

## [The Ascea: Last Duel][Another Place] has an easy foundation for guiding you through its steps.
##  In the beginning the game asks if you wish to create or randomize a character, choosing random immediately brings you to combat with your opponent. Be ready! Creating a character guides you through three steps:
    Weapons (Claymore, Fireball)
    Attack Type: Physical, Magical
    Damage Type: Pierce, Blunt, Slash || Dark, Earth, Faith, Fire, Frost, Lightning
    Physical Weapons - One-Hand / Two-Hand / Crit Bonusues / Dodge Bonuses
    Magical Weapons - Offensive Properties / Defensive Properties
    
    Shields (Parrying Buckler, Scutum)
    Physical Resistance (Added when Posturing)
    Magical Resistance (Added when Posturing)
    Roll (How fast you can roll!)
    
    Armor (Legionnaire's Regalia, Knight's Full Plate) 
    Armor Type - E.g. Pierce weapons perform poorly on plate-mail armor.
    Physical Defense - Blesesd or Cursed by Weapon Selection
    Magical Defense - Blessed or Cursed by Weapon Selection
## After that you have the task of assessing based on your equipment selection, what your best combat abilities are between
    Attack - The patented double-attack. A tried and true tactic of every rpg eventually, more damage is always the best solution
    Dodge - Assesses your dodge based on your weapon, shield, and/or armor to evade the opponent's attack.
    Posture - Adds the strength of your shield to your defenses.
    Roll - A free attack, use absolutely every time you can good lord.
## And with that I say you have a good idea of what's in store for yourself, and there's no need to bore you with inane detail yet to be discovered (and more to added)!

# Next Steps
### * Adding image icons for equipment upon selection with tooltips
### * Icon images embedded in the tooltips themselves
### * Audio, while I've played many a game with zero sound like this, that is more resembles the still image rendering era of muds emerging out of strictly text-based, audio isn't a far stretch and is the next major addition I'll be working on.
### * Modifers to existing kinds of equipment and including new modifiers via increasing weapon, shield, and armor attributes
### * More weapons, shields, and armor
### * The ability to hold multiple weapons and equipping them as needed between combat rounds
### * More opponents, with more opponent attack variety, including the chance to dodge
### * The ability for weapons to have different attacks within themselves, at the moment I'm hamstrung so each settles on one particular strike movment i.e. the Gladius was primarily a thrusting weapoon despite being a sword that can absolutely deal slash damage. This will add complexity when considering the armor of an opponent.
### * More action versatility, including posturing to incorporate a shield bash effect, a heal button augmented by equipment, etc...
